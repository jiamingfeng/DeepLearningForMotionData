# DeepLearningForMotionData

An AI library to recognize pattern in motion data is very powerful.
There is very broad application for reliable AI/Deep Learning model
* Motion Data Auto Tagging
* Behaviour analysics for statisc purpose

Like most of the AI application, we need to solve three problems:   
1. How to process the raw data   
2. How to traing a model to find pattern or filter the data till we find what we need  
3. How to present the result
